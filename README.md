# ARMCO-Star-Wars-Project-Sample
A sample project on how to organize the ARMCO Star Wars Mod project.

# Setup
1. Download and install Github Desktop from here: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Create a Github account and contact me so I can add you as a collaborator.
3. Clone the repository to wherever you want.
4. Run the create link bat file in any mod subfolder to link that mod within the Space Engineers \Mods\-folder. It will now appear as a regular folder within \Mods\ and is seen as that by Space Engineers as well.
5. If you want to remove a mod link from \Mods\, run the remove link bat in the mod's subfolder.
